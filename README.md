# BE 223A Course Project

Course name: Bioengineering 223A - Programming Laboratory for Medical and Imaging Informatics I

Instructor: William Speier 

This course project aims to develop an application that automatically generates 3D brain surfaces with color labeling based on underlying neurological signals. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

    - Login required for downloading
- Python 3.6
    - Download Python from their website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - Dependencies
