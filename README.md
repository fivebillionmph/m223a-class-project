# BE 223A Course Project

Course name: Bioengineering 223A - Programming Laboratory for Medical and Imaging Informatics I

Instructor: William Speier 

This course project aims to develop an application that automatically generates 3D brain surfaces with color labeling based on underlying neurological signals. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- BrainSuite 18a 
    - Download the most recent version of BrainSuite from their website: http://forums.brainsuite.org/download/
    - Login required for downloading
- Python 2.7 or above
    - Download Python from their website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - Dependencies
        - postgresql, psycopg2, psycopg2.extras, psycopg2.extensions, config, os, sys, csv, pandas, scipy, numpy, nibabel, mayavi, PyQt5, SimpleITK, math, traits

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
