## TASKS TO COMPLETE

#### Signal processing
* incorporate Audio signal processing component (Ge)
    * add request for audio file from user
    * add component call to the project wrapper as analysis method 5
* recompile Jake's signal processing to Python 3.6
* resolve .dat vs .csv discrepancy (Amy, David, Jake, Mohammad)
    * request .dat file from user and convert to .csv where needed
    * Amy and David (methods 1 and 2) use .csv as input
        * add .dat->.csv conversion to these with if statement
    * Jake and Mohammad (methods 3 and 4) use .dat as input
    * perhaps, since these methods are supposed to be called for different experiment types, we could restrict methods 
    1+2 to EEG expts and methods 3+4 to ECoG expts.
#### Heat map
* test functionality to display multiple signal analyses 
* run further tests on classroom computer
